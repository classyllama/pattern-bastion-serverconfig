# <BASTION_NAME> IaC

Bastion IaC (Infrastructure as Code) management

This repository is for managing the configuration of the Infrastructure in a similar manner to how code is revisioned and tracked in a git repository. In some cases, we are not using tools to manage the configuration but a reference of commands run on the environment to make it conform to the configuration desired.

Recent changes can be found in the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) file.
